## Project Name: calculator

## Program Name: main.go
    This is a simple calculator program that respects the rules of BODMAS or PEMDAS
    It uses an algorithm called the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

    RPN converts an expression in Infix Notation to RPN for easier compuation
    ** Example **
    Consider the number `1+2*3` in Infix Notation our program takes the expression through a series of
    transformation in order to convert it into RPN.
    
    ** How To Convert Infix Notation to RPN **
    stack = []
    `1+2*3`
    step 1:
            push `1` to `stack`
    step 2:
            push `2` to `stack`
    step 3:
            push `+` to `stack`

    compute: what is in the stak
    step 4: 
            push `*` to `stack`
